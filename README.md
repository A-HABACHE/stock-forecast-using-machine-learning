# stock-forecast-using-machine-learning
In my previous role, I had the opportunity to work extensively with stock data analysis and forecasting for international companies. My tasks involved importing relevant libraries and datasets, where I meticulously examined and described the data's characteristics. One pivotal aspect of my work was delving into the historical view of closing prices, gaining insights into market trends and patterns. I also implemented moving average analysis on various stocks to discern their performance over time. A highlight of this experience was my involvement in predicting the stock price of a tech giant like Apple. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data, I engaged in the complex process of price forecasting, harnessing data-driven insights to make informed predictions about future market behavior. This experience further solidified my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and its practical applications in the financial domain.
